# Dotfiles

A neat copy of everything clogging up my home folder whenever I'm looking for something important.

## Other stuff I've used before, but want to keep the configuration for.

### [Termite][termite]

I quite like this terminal. It's always my goto if something is not working properly in alacritty. I sometimes spin it up if I really need blinking text for some reason.

However, it's deprecated ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### [Kitty][kitty]

This terminal is quick, but just a tad bit "too quick" for me. By only focusing on speed, it leaves features like IMEs hanging, which is my reason for using alacritty instead.

### [Ranger][ranger]

To be honest, I don't use file managers that much nowadays. `cd` and `ls` is my friend.
