# Dotfiles

A neat copy of everything clogging up my home folder whenever I'm looking for something important.

## Featuring:

| | |
|-|-|
| [emacs][emacs] | vim, just better |
| [GHC][ghc] | Compiler settings for code I don't understand  |
| [htop][htop] | CPU go brrrr |
| [ncmpcpp][ncmpcpp]/[mpd][mpd] | Music player I can't live without |
| [newsboat][newsboat] | Good in the morning, with a cup of coffee |
| rofi | Ask me anything! |
| [tmux][tmux] | Terminals inside terminals inside terminals |
| [qutebrowser][qutebrowser] | Surfing the web without a mouse |
| [nvim][nvim] | emacs, just better |
| [xmonad][xmonad] | windows, but not actually |
| [zathura][zathura] | PDF is probably the most A4 format I know of |
| [zsh][zsh] | Because none of the cool kids use bash anymore |

## Other stuff I've used before, but want to keep the configuration for.

### [Termite][termite]

I quite like this terminal. It's always my goto if something is not working properly in alacritty. I sometimes spin it up if I really need blinking text for some reason.

### [Kitty][kitty]

This terminal is quick, but just a tad bit too quick for me. It kinda handles IMEs badly, which is my reason for using alacritty instead.

### [Ranger][ranger]

To be honest, I don't use file managers that much nowadays. `cd` and `ls` is my friend.
